# Template
When adding documentation for a new feature or updating documentation of an existing feature, please keep this template in mind.

## Step 1
- Create a folder labled `Feature Name`
- Create subfolders within `Feature Name` for sub features labeled `Sub Feature Name`
- Create .md files for each UE file required for the feature (labeled UEFileX.md)
- Place these files in the Feature or Sub Feature folder(s) - where they make the most sense
